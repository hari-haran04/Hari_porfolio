                    I am <strong>Hariharan N</strong>, a passionate Software Developer from <strong>Coimbatore</strong>,
                    currently pursuing <strong>B.Tech in Computer Science and Business Systems</strong> at PSG Institute
                    of Technology and Applied Research with a <strong>CGPA of 8.8</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I specialize in building scalable applications, designing robust backend systems, and crafting
                    elegant mobile and web solutions. From NFC-based checkout systems with patented innovation to server
                    monitoring applications and sports community platforms, I enjoy transforming real-world problems
                    into reliable digital products.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My journey is driven by curiosity, discipline, and the mindset to continuously improve. I strongly
                    believe that clean architecture, security, and performance define the soul of any software system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond coding, I actively participate in hackathons, ideathons, and technical competitions — pushing
                    myself to think beyond boundaries and innovate with impact.
